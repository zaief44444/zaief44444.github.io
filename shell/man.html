<h1>man解説</h1>
<p>July 11, 2020
<p> ネット検索をするよりもmanで調べた方が速い場合は多い. 例えば, man asciiとすればASCIIコードがすぐにわかる. 基本的な使い方をまとめていく. 
<p> man man としてみるとmanのmanualが出てくるが長々としている上によくわからない部分も多い.

DESCRIPTION
       man  is  the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.
       The manual page associated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A section, if  provided,  will  direct
       man  to look only in that section of the manual.  The default action is to search in all of the available sections following
       a pre-defined order (see DEFAULTS), and to show only the first page found, even if page exists in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional section names include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS,  RETURN VALUE,  ERRORS,
       ENVIRONMENT, FILES, VERSIONS, CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.

       The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

       bold text          type exactly as shown.
       italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
       [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
       argument ...       argument is repeatable.
       [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.

       Exact  rendering may vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually not be able to render italics when
       running in a terminal, and will typically use underlined or coloured text instead.

       The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some cases it is advisable
       to illustrate several exclusive invocations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this manual page.
